description: Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis using SpecKit
---
1. Read the command definition from `.gemini/commands/speckit.analyze.toml` (or similar path in your workspace).
2. Parse the `prompt` field from the TOML file.
3. STRICTLY follow the instructions in the prompt to analyze `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`.
4. Do NOT modify any files; only produce the report as requested.
